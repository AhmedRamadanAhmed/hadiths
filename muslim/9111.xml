<arabic-text>حدثنا ابن نمير، حدثنا أبي، حدثنا حنظلة، عن القاسم بن
محمد، قال سمعت عائشة، تقول كانت صلاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
من الليل عشر ركعات ويوتر بسجدة ويركع ركعتى الفجر فتلك ثلاث عشرة
ركعة ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'A'isha thus reported about the (night prayer) of the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): He used to sleep in the
early part of the night, and woke up in the latter part. If he then
wished intercourse with his wife, he satisfied his desire, and then
went to sleep; and when the first call to prayer was made he jumped
up (by Allah, she, i. e. 'A'isha, did not say" he stood up" ), and
poured water over him (by Allah she, i. e. 'A'isha, did not say
that he took a bath but I know what she meant) and if he did not
have an intercourse, he performed ablution, just as a man performs
ablution for prayer and then observed two rak'ahs.</english-text>
