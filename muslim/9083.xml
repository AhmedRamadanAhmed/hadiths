<arabic-text>وحدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة، حدثنا أبو أسامة، حدثنا
عبيد الله، عن نافع، عن ابن عمر، قال صليت مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم قبل الظهر سجدتين وبعدها سجدتين وبعد المغرب سجدتين وبعد العشاء
سجدتين وبعد الجمعة سجدتين فأما المغرب والعشاء والجمعة فصليت مع
النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم في بيته ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Abdullah b. Shaqiq said: I asked 'A'isha about the
Messenger of Allah's (may peace be upon him) voluntary prayers, and
she replied: Before the noon prayer, he used to pray four rak'abs
in my house; then would go out and lead the people in prayer; then
come in and pray two rak'ahs. He would then lead the people in the
sunset prayer; then come in and pray two rak'abs. Then he would
lead the people in the 'Isha' prayer, and enter my house and pray
two rak'ahs. He would pray nine rak'ahs during the night, including
Witr. At night he would pray for a long time standing and for a
long time sitting, and when he recited the Holy Qur'an while
standing, he would bow and prostrate himself from the standing
position, and when he recited while sitting, he would bow and
prostrate himself from the sitting position, and when it was dawn
he would pray two rak'ahs.</english-text>
