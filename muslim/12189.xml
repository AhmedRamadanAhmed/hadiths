<arabic-text>حدثنا هداب بن خالد الأزدي، حدثنا همام بن يحيى، حدثنا
قتادة، عن الحسن، عن ضبة بن محصن، عن أم سلمة، أن رسول الله صلى الله
عليه وسلم قال ‏"‏ ستكون أمراء فتعرفون وتنكرون فمن عرف برئ ومن أنكر
سلم ولكن من رضي وتابع ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قالوا أفلا نقاتلهم قال ‏"‏ لا ما صلوا
‏"‏ ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It has been narrated on the authority of Umm Salama
that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: In the
near future there will be Amirs and you will like their good deeds
and dislike their bad deeds. One who sees through their bad deeds
(and tries to prevent their repetition by his band or through his
speech), is absolved from blame, but one who hates their bad deeds
(in the heart of his heart, being unable to prevent their
recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) fafe ( so far as
God's wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds
and imitates them is spiritually ruined. People asked (the Holy
Prophet): Shouldn't we fight against them? He replied: No, as long
as they say their prayers.</english-text>
