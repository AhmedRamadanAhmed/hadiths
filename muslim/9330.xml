<arabic-text>وحدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة، حدثنا يحيى بن آدم، عن
سفيان، عن موسى بن، عقبة عن نافع، عن ابن عمر، قال صلى رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم صلاة الخوف في بعض أيامه فقامت طائفة معه وطائفة بإزاء
العدو فصلى بالذين معه ركعة ثم ذهبوا وجاء الآخرون فصلى بهم ركعة ثم
قضت الطائفتان ركعة ركعة - قال - وقال ابن عمر فإذا كان خوف أكثر من
ذلك فصل راكبا أو قائما تومئ إيماء ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I observed prayer in
danger with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). We drew
ourselves up in two rows, one row behind him with the enemy between
us and the Qibla. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)
said: Allah is Most Great, and we all said it. He then bowed and we
all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing, we all raised (our
heads). He then went down in prostration along with the row close
to him, and the rear row faced the enemy; then when the Apostle of
Allah (may peace be upon him) completed the prostration, ; and then
stood up, the row near to him also did it; then went down the rear
row in prostration; then they stood up; then the rear row went to
the front and the front row went to the rear. Then the Apostle of
Allah (may peace he upon him) bowed down and we all bowed. He then
raised his head from bowing and we also raised (our heads). He and
the row close to him which I had been in the rear then went down in
prostration In the first rak'ah, whereas the rear row faced the
enemy. And when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and
the rear row close to him had finished the prostration, the rear
row went down and prostrated themselves; then the Apostle of Allah
pronounced the salutation and we also pronounced the salutation.
(Jabir said we hadith) as your guards behave with their
chiefs.</english-text>
