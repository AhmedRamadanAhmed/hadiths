<arabic-text>حدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة، حدثنا عفان، حدثنا حماد بن
سلمة، حدثنا ثابت، عن أنس، قال كنت ردف أبي طلحة يوم خيبر وقدمي تمس
قدم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم - قال - فأتيناهم حين بزغت الشمس
وقد أخرجوا مواشيهم وخرجوا بفئوسهم ومكاتلهم ومرورهم فقالوا محمد
والخميس - قال - وقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ خربت خيبر إنا
إذا نزلنا بساحة قوم فساء صباح المنذرين ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال وهزمهم الله عز
وجل ووقعت في سهم دحية جارية جميلة فاشتراها رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم بسبعة أرؤس ثم دفعها إلى أم سليم تصنعها له وتهيئها - قال وأحسبه
قال - وتعتد في بيتها وهي صفية بنت حيى - قال - وجعل رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم وليمتها التمر والأقط والسمن فحصت الأرض أفاحيص وجيء
بالأنطاع فوضعت فيها وجيء بالأقط والسمن فشبع الناس - قال - وقال
الناس لا ندري أتزوجها أم اتخذها أم ولد ‏.‏ قالوا إن حجبها فهى
امرأته وإن لم يحجبها فهى أم ولد فلما أراد أن يركب حجبها فقعدت على
عجز البعير فعرفوا أنه قد تزوجها ‏.‏ فلما دنوا من المدينة دفع رسول
الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ودفعنا - قال - فعثرت الناقة العضباء وندر
رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وندرت فقام فسترها وقد أشرفت النساء
فقلن أبعد الله اليهودية ‏.‏ قال قلت يا أبا حمزة أوقع رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم قال إي والله لقد وقع ‏.‏ قال أنس وشهدت وليمة زينب
فأشبع الناس خبزا ولحما وكان يبعثني فأدعو الناس فلما فرغ قام وتبعته
فتخلف رجلان استأنس بهما الحديث لم يخرجا فجعل يمر على نسائه فيسلم
على كل واحدة منهن ‏"‏ سلام عليكم كيف أنتم يا أهل البيت ‏"‏ ‏.‏
فيقولون بخير يا رسول الله كيف وجدت أهلك فيقول ‏"‏ بخير ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فلما
فرغ رجع ورجعت معه فلما بلغ الباب إذا هو بالرجلين قد استأنس بهما
الحديث فلما رأياه قد رجع قاما فخرجا فوالله ما أدري أنا أخبرته أم
أنزل عليه الوحى بأنهما قد خرجا فرجع ورجعت معه فلما وضع رجله في
أسكفة الباب أرخى الحجاب بيني وبينه وأنزل الله تعالى هذه الآية ‏{‏
لا تدخلوا بيوت النبي إلا أن يؤذن لكم‏}‏ الآية ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was
sitting behind Abu Talha on the Day of Khaibar and my feet touched
the foot of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and we came
(to the people of Khaibar) when the sun had risen and they had
driven out their cattle, and had themselves come out with their
axes, large baskets and hatchets, and they said: (Here come)
Muhammad and the army. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a
people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur'an, xxxvii.
177). Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the
inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a
beautiful girl, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) got
her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm
Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for
marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the
impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period
of 'Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim's) house. (The woman) was Safiyya
daughter of Huyayy. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
arranged the wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined
butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths,
and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were
placed there. And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We
do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a
free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy
Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free
married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then
she should be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her
wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they
came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina,
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) drove (his ride) quickly
and so we did. 'Adba' (the name of Allah's Apostle's camel)
stumbled and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) fell down
and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet)
stood up and covered her. woman looked towards her and said: May
Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba
Hamza, did Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) really fall
down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell down. Anas said: I
also saw the wedding feast of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet)
served bread and meat to the people, and made them eat to their
heart's content, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to call people,
and as he was free (from the ceremony) he stood up and I followed
him. Two persons were left and they were busy in talking and did
not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) then
proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with
as-Salamu 'alaikum to every one of them and said: Members of the
household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we are in
good state 'How do you find your family? He would say: In good
state. When he was free from (this work of exchanging greetings) he
came back, and I also came back along with him. And as he reached
the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking.
And when they saw him having returned, they stood up and went out;
and by Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, or there
was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone. He (the
Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned along with him,
and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a
curtain between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that
Allah revealed this verse: (" O you who believe), do not enter the
houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to 'you" (xxxiii.
53).</english-text>
