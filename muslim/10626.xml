<arabic-text>حدثنا هناد بن السري، حدثنا ابن أبي زائدة، أخبرني ابن
أبي سليمان، عن عطاء، قال لما احترق البيت زمن يزيد بن معاوية حين
غزاها أهل الشام فكان من أمره ما كان تركه ابن الزبير حتى قدم الناس
الموسم يريد أن يجرئهم - أو يحربهم - على أهل الشام فلما صدر الناس
قال يا أيها الناس أشيروا على في الكعبة أنقضها ثم أبني بناءها أو
أصلح ما وهى منها قال ابن عباس فإني قد فرق لي رأى فيها أرى أن تصلح
ما وهى منها وتدع بيتا أسلم الناس عليه وأحجارا أسلم الناس عليها وبعث
عليها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏.‏ فقال ابن الزبير لو كان أحدكم
احترق بيته ما رضي حتى يجده فكيف بيت ربكم إني مستخير ربي ثلاثا ثم
عازم على أمري فلما مضى الثلاث أجمع رأيه على أن ينقضها فتحاماه الناس
أن ينزل بأول الناس يصعد فيه أمر من السماء حتى صعده رجل فألقى منه
حجارة فلما لم يره الناس أصابه شىء تتابعوا فنقضوه حتى بلغوا به الأرض
فجعل ابن الزبير أعمدة فستر عليها الستور حتى ارتفع بناؤه ‏.‏ وقال
ابن الزبير إني سمعت عائشة تقول إن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال ‏"‏
لولا أن الناس حديث عهدهم بكفر وليس عندي من النفقة ما يقوي على بنائه
لكنت أدخلت فيه من الحجر خمس أذرع ولجعلت لها بابا يدخل الناس منه
وبابا يخرجون منه ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال فأنا اليوم أجد ما أنفق ولست أخاف الناس
- قال - فزاد فيه خمس أذرع من الحجر حتى أبدى أسا نظر الناس إليه فبنى
عليه البناء وكان طول الكعبة ثماني عشرة ذراعا فلما زاد فيه استقصره
فزاد في طوله عشر أذرع وجعل له بابين أحدهما يدخل منه والآخر يخرج منه
‏.‏ فلما قتل ابن الزبير كتب الحجاج إلى عبد الملك بن مروان يخبره
بذلك ويخبره أن ابن الزبير قد وضع البناء على أس نظر إليه العدول من
أهل مكة ‏.‏ فكتب إليه عبد الملك إنا لسنا من تلطيخ ابن الزبير في شىء
أما ما زاد في طوله فأقره وأما ما زاد فيه من الحجر فرده إلى بنائه
وسد الباب الذي فتحه ‏.‏ فنقضه وأعاده إلى بنائه ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Ata' reported: The House was burnt during the time
of Yazid b. Muawiya when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca).
And it happened with it (the Ka'ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn
Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same state)
until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind
was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against
the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O
people, advise me about the Ka'ba. Should I demolish it and then
build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has
been damaged of it? Ibn 'Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me
according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion
which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in
which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the
same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah's
Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair
said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be
contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House
of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would
seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my
mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made
up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity
might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb
(over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one
(took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its
stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they
followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then
Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to
provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its
construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I
heard 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah's Apostle
(may peace be upon him) had observed: If the people had Rot
recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to
reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely
excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also
have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for
their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no
fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this
change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to
it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat
Ibrahim had built the Ka'ba). and the people saw that and it was
upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the
Ka'ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was
in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as
compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area)
was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one
of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When
Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to
'Abd al-Malik (b. Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him
that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka'ba)
on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which
reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. 'Abd al-Malik wrote to
him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair in
anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of
length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to
(its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had
opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it
(that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous)
foundations.</english-text>
