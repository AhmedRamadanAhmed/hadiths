<english-text>It has been narrated on the authority of 'Arfaja who
said: I have heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
say: Different evils will make their appearance in the near future.
Anyone who tries to disrupt the affairs of this Umma while they are
united you should strike him with the sword whoever he be. (If
remonstrance does not prevail with him and he does not desist from
his disruptive activities, he is to be killed.)</english-text>
