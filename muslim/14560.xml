<english-text>This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu
Huraira through another chain of transmitters that Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The (members of the) first
group which would get into Paradise will have their faces as bright
as stars in the sky. They would neither pass water, nor void
excrement, nor will they suffer from catarrh, nor will they spit,
and their combs would be made of gold, and their sweat will be
musk, the fuel of their brazier will be aloes, and their wives will
be large-eyed maidens and their form would be alike as one single
person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits
tall.</english-text>
