<arabic-text>وحدثنا محمد بن المثنى، ومحمد بن حاتم، قالا حدثنا معاذ
بن معاذ، حدثنا ابن، عون عن محمد، قال قال جندب جئت يوم الجرعة فإذا
رجل جالس فقلت ليهراقن اليوم ها هنا دماء ‏.‏ فقال ذاك الرجل كلا
والله ‏.‏ قلت بلى والله ‏.‏ قال كلا والله ‏.‏ قلت بلى والله ‏.‏ قال
كلا والله إنه لحديث رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حدثنيه ‏.‏ قلت بئس
الجليس لي أنت منذ اليوم تسمعني أخالفك وقد سمعته من رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم فلا تنهاني ثم قلت ما هذا الغضب فأقبلت عليه وأسأله
فإذا الرجل حذيفة ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Jundub reported: I came on the day of Jara'a that a
person was (found) sitting. I said: They would shed their blood
today. That person said: By Allah. not at all. I said: By Allah, of
course, they would do it. He said: By Allah, they would not do it.
I said: By Allah, of course, they would do it. He said: By Allah,
they would not do it, and I have heard a hadith of Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) which I am narrating to you in
this connection. I said: You are a bad seat fellow. I have been
opposing you since morning and you are listening to me in spite of
the fact that you have heard a hadith from Allah's Apostle (may
peace be upon him) (contrary to ray statement). I myself felt that
there was no use of this annoyance. (He could tell me earlier that
it was a hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him], and I
would not have opposed him at all.) I turned my face toward him and
asked him and he was Hadrat Hudhaifa.</english-text>
