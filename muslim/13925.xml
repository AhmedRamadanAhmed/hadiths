<arabic-text>حدثنا زهير بن حرب، حدثنا يزيد بن هارون، أخبرنا جرير بن
حازم، حدثنا محمد بن سيرين، عن أبي هريرة، عن النبي صلى الله عليه
وسلم قال ‏"‏ لم يتكلم في المهد إلا ثلاثة عيسى ابن مريم وصاحب جريج
وكان جريج رجلا عابدا فاتخذ صومعة فكان فيها فأتته أمه وهو يصلي فقالت
يا جريج ‏.‏ فقال يا رب أمي وصلاتي ‏.‏ فأقبل على صلاته فانصرفت فلما
كان من الغد أتته وهو يصلي فقالت يا جريج فقال يا رب أمي وصلاتي فأقبل
على صلاته فانصرفت فلما كان من الغد أتته وهو يصلي فقالت يا جريج ‏.‏
فقال أى رب أمي وصلاتي ‏.‏ فأقبل على صلاته فقالت اللهم لا تمته حتى
ينظر إلى وجوه المومسات ‏.‏ فتذاكر بنو إسرائيل جريجا وعبادته وكانت
امرأة بغي يتمثل بحسنها فقالت إن شئتم لأفتننه لكم - قال - فتعرضت له
فلم يلتفت إليها فأتت راعيا كان يأوي إلى صومعته فأمكنته من نفسها
فوقع عليها فحملت فلما ولدت قالت هو من جريج ‏.‏ فأتوه فاستنزلوه
وهدموا صومعته وجعلوا يضربونه فقال ما شأنكم قالوا زنيت بهذه البغي
فولدت منك ‏.‏ فقال أين الصبي فجاءوا به فقال دعوني حتى أصلي فصلى
فلما انصرف أتى الصبي فطعن في بطنه وقال يا غلام من أبوك قال فلان
الراعي - قال - فأقبلوا على جريج يقبلونه ويتمسحون به وقالوا نبني لك
صومعتك من ذهب ‏.‏ قال لا أعيدوها من طين كما كانت ‏.‏ ففعلوا ‏.‏
وبينا صبي يرضع من أمه فمر رجل راكب على دابة فارهة وشارة حسنة فقالت
أمه اللهم اجعل ابني مثل هذا ‏.‏ فترك الثدى وأقبل إليه فنظر إليه
فقال اللهم لا تجعلني مثله ‏.‏ ثم أقبل على ثديه فجعل يرتضع ‏.‏ قال
فكأني أنظر إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو يحكي ارتضاعه بإصبعه
السبابة في فمه فجعل يمصها ‏.‏ قال ومروا بجارية وهم يضربونها ويقولون
زنيت سرقت ‏.‏ وهي تقول حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل ‏.‏ فقالت أمه اللهم لا
تجعل ابني مثلها ‏.‏ فترك الرضاع ونظر إليها فقال اللهم اجعلني مثلها
‏.‏ فهناك تراجعا الحديث فقالت حلقى مر رجل حسن الهيئة فقلت اللهم
اجعل ابني مثله ‏.‏ فقلت اللهم لا تجعلني مثله ‏.‏ ومروا بهذه الأمة
وهم يضربونها ويقولون زنيت سرقت ‏.‏ فقلت اللهم لا تجعل ابني مثلها
‏.‏ فقلت اللهم اجعلني مثلها قال إن ذاك الرجل كان جبارا فقلت اللهم
لا تجعلني مثله ‏.‏ وإن هذه يقولون لها زنيت ‏.‏ ولم تزن وسرقت ولم
تسرق فقلت اللهم اجعلني مثلها ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be
upon him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three
(persons), Christ son of Mary, the second one the companion of
Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined himself in
that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said:
Juraij. He said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am
engaged in) my prayer. He continued with the prayer. She returned
and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and she
said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while
I am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she
went back, and then on the next day she again came and he was busy
in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is
calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with
the prayer, and she said: My Lord, don't give him death unless he
has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The story of Juraij and that
of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani Isra'il.
There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said
(to the people): If you like I can allure him to evil. She
presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her). She came to
a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him
and he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant
arid when she gave birth to a child she said: This is from Juraij.
So they came and asked him to get down and demolished the temple
and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You
have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given
birth to a child from your loins. He said: Where is the child? They
brought him (the child) and he said: just leave me so that I should
observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he
came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is
your father? lie said: He is such shepherd. So they turned towards
Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking blessing) and said:
We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No,
just rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then
there was a babe who was sucking his mother that a person dressed
in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His mother said: O Allah,
make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began
to see towards him, and said: O Allah, don't make me like him. He
then returned to the chest and began to suck the milk of his
mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am seeing
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the
scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and
sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further reported Allah's Apostle
(may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him a
girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed
adultery and you have committed theft and she was saying: Allah is
enough for me and He is my good Protector, and his mother said: O
Allah, don't make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,
and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and
there was a talk between them. She said: O with shaven head, a
good-looking person happened to pass by and I said: O Allah, make
my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like him,
and they passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying:
You committed fornication and you committed theft, and I said: O
Allah, don't make my child like her, and you said: O Allah, make me
like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said:
O Allah, don't make me like him, and they were saying about her:
You committed fornication whereas in fact she had not committed
that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she had
not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like
her.</english-text>
