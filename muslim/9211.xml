<arabic-text>وحدثني محمد بن حاتم، حدثنا بهز، حدثنا وهيب، حدثنا موسى
بن عقبة، قال سمعت أبا النضر، عن بسر بن سعيد، عن زيد بن ثابت، أن
النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم اتخذ حجرة في المسجد من حصير فصلى رسول الله
صلى الله عليه وسلم فيها ليالي حتى اجتمع إليه ناس ‏.‏ فذكر نحوه وزاد
فيه ‏"‏ ولو كتب عليكم ما قمتم به ‏"‏ ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'A'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) had a mat and he used it for making an apartment
during the night and observed prayer in it, and the people began to
pray with him, and he spread it (the mat) during the day time. The
people crowded round him one night. He (the Holy Prophet) then
Eaid: O people, perform such acts as you are capable of doing, for
Allah does not grow weary but you will get tired. The acts most
pleasing to Allah are those which are done continuously, even if
they are small. And it was the habit of the members of Muhammad's
(may peace be upon him) household that whenever they did an act
they did it continuously.</english-text>
