<arabic-text>حدثنا محمد بن المثنى، ومحمد بن حاتم، وعبد بن حميد،
وأبو معن الرقاشي قالوا حدثنا عمر بن يونس، حدثنا عكرمة بن عمار،
حدثنا يحيى بن أبي كثير، حدثني أبو سلمة، بن عبد الرحمن بن عوف قال
سألت عائشة أم المؤمنين بأى شىء كان نبي الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
يفتتح صلاته إذا قام من الليل قالت كان إذا قام من الليل افتتح صلاته
‏"‏ اللهم رب جبرائيل وميكائيل وإسرافيل فاطر السموات والأرض عالم
الغيب والشهادة أنت تحكم بين عبادك فيما كانوا فيه يختلفون اهدني لما
اختلف فيه من الحق بإذنك إنك تهدي من تشاء إلى صراط مستقيم ‏"‏

<english-text>'Ali b. Abu Talib reported that when the Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) got up at night for prayer he would
say: I turn my face in complete devotion to One Who is the
Originator of the heaven and the earth and I am not of the
polytheists. Verily my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying
are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds; There is no partner with Him
and this is what I have been commanded (to profess and believe) and
I am of the believers. O Allah, Thou art the King, there is no god
but Thee, Thou art my Lord, and I am Thy bondman. I wronged myself
and make a confession of my Sin. Forgive all my sins, for no one
forgives the sins but Thee, and guide me in the best of conduct for
none but Thee guideth anyone (in) good conduct. Remove sins from
me, for none else but Thou can remove sins from me. Here I am at
Thy service, and Grace is to Thee and the whole of good is in Thine
hand, and one cannot get nearneststo Thee through evil. My (power
as well as existence) is due to Thee (Thine grace) and I turn to
Thee (for supplication). Thou art blessed and Thou art exalted. I
seek forgiveness from Thee and turn to Thee in repentance: and when
he would bow, he would say: O Allah, it is for Thee that I bowed. I
affirm my faith in Thee and I submit to Thee, and submit humbly
before Thee my hearing, my eyesight, my marrow, my bone, my sinew;
and when he would raise his head, he would say: O Allah, our Lord,
praise is due to Thee, (the praise) with which is filled the
heavens and the earth, and with which is filled that (space) which
exists between them, and filled with anything that Thou desireth
afterward. And when he prostrated himself, he (the Holy Prophet)
would say: O Allah, it is to Thee that I prostrate myself and it is
in Thee that I affirm my faith, and I submit to Thee. My face is
submitted before One Who created it, and shaped it, and opened his
faculties of hearing and seeing. Blessed is Allah, the best of
Creators; and he would then say between Tashahhud and the
pronouncing of salutation: Forgive me of the earlier and later open
and secret (sins) and that where I made transgression and that Thou
knowest better than I. Thou art the First and the Last. There is no
god, but Thee.</english-text>
