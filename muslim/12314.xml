<arabic-text>حدثنا يحيى بن حبيب الحارثي، حدثنا خالد بن الحارث،
حدثنا ابن جريج، حدثني يونس بن يوسف، عن سليمان بن يسار، قال تفرق
الناس عن أبي هريرة، فقال له ناتل أهل الشام أيها الشيخ حدثنا حديثا
سمعته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال نعم سمعت رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم يقول ‏"‏ إن أول الناس يقضى يوم القيامة عليه رجل
استشهد فأتي به فعرفه نعمه فعرفها قال فما عملت فيها قال قاتلت فيك
حتى استشهدت ‏.‏ قال كذبت ولكنك قاتلت لأن يقال جريء ‏.‏ فقد قيل ‏.‏
ثم أمر به فسحب على وجهه حتى ألقي في النار ورجل تعلم العلم وعلمه
وقرأ القرآن فأتي به فعرفه نعمه فعرفها قال فما عملت فيها قال تعلمت
العلم وعلمته وقرأت فيك القرآن ‏.‏ قال كذبت ولكنك تعلمت العلم ليقال
عالم ‏.‏ وقرأت القرآن ليقال هو قارئ ‏.‏ فقد قيل ثم أمر به فسحب على
وجهه حتى ألقي في النار ‏.‏ ورجل وسع الله عليه وأعطاه من أصناف المال
كله فأتي به فعرفه نعمه فعرفها قال فما عملت فيها قال ما تركت من سبيل
تحب أن ينفق فيها إلا أنفقت فيها لك قال كذبت ولكنك فعلت ليقال هو
جواد ‏.‏ فقد قيل ثم أمر به فسحب على وجهه ثم ألقي في النار ‏"‏

<english-text>It has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman b.
Yasar who said: People dispersed from around Abu Huraira, and
Natil, who was from the Syrians. said to him: O Shaikh, relate (to
us) a tradition you have heard from the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him). He said: Yes. I heard the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) say: The first of men (whose case) will be
decided on the Day of Judgment will be a man who died as a martyr.
He shall be brought (before the Judgment Seat). Allah will make him
recount His blessings (i. e. the blessings which He had bestowed
upon him) and he will recount them (and admit having enjoyed them
in his life). (Then) will Allah say: What did you do (to requite
these blessings)? He will say: I fought for Thee until I died as a
martyr. Allah will say: You have told a lie. You fought that you
might be called a" brave warrior". And you were called so. (Then)
orders will be passed against him and he will be dragged with his
face downward and cast into Hell. Then will be brought forward a
man who acquired knowledge and imparted it (to others) and recited
the Qur'an. He will be brought And Allah will make him recount His
blessings and he will recount them (and admit having enjoyed them
in his lifetime). Then will Allah ask: What did you do (to requite
these blessings)? He will say: I acquired knowledge and
disseminated it and recited the Qur'an seeking Thy pleasure. Allah
will say: You have told a lie. You acquired knowledge so that you
might be called" a scholar," and you recited the Qur'an so that it
might be said:" He is a Qari" and such has been said. Then orders
will be passed against him and he shall be dragged with his face
downward and cast into the Fire. Then will be brought a man whom
Allah had made abundantly rich and had granted every kind of
wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make him recount His
blessings and he will recount them and (admit having enjoyed them
in his lifetime). Allah will (then) ask: What have you done (to
requite these blessings)? He will say: I spent money in every cause
in which Thou wished that it should be spent. Allah will say: You
are lying. You did (so) that it might be said about (You):" He is a
generous fellow" and so it was said. Then will Allah pass orders
and he will be dragged with his face downward and thrown into
Hell.</english-text>
