<arabic-text>حدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة، حدثنا محمد بن بشر، حدثني
إسماعيل بن أبي، خالد حدثني عبد الله بن عيسى، عن عبد الرحمن بن أبي
ليلى، أخبرني أبى بن كعب، أنه كان جالسا في المسجد إذ دخل رجل فصلى
فقرأ قراءة واقتص الحديث بمثل حديث ابن نمير ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ubayy b. Ka'b reported that the Apostle of Allah (may
peace be upon him) was near the tank of Banu Ghifar that Gabriel
came to him and said: Allah has commanded you to recite to your
people the Qur'an in one dialect. Upon this he said: I ask from
Allah pardon and forgiveness. My people are not capable of doing
it. He then came for the second time and said: Allah has commanded
you that you should recite the Qur'an to your people in two
dialects. Upon this he (the Holy prophet) again said: I seek pardon
and forgiveness from Allah, my people would not be able to do so.
He (Gabriel) came for the third time and said: Allah has commanded
you to recite the Qur'an to your people in three dialects. Upon
this he said: I ask pardon and forgiveness from Allah. My people
would not be able to do it. He then came to him for the fourth time
and said: Allah has commanded you to recite the Qur'an to your
people in seven dialects, and in whichever dialect they would
recite, they would be right.</english-text>
