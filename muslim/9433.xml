<arabic-text>وحدثنا محمد بن عبد الله بن نمير، حدثنا أبي، حدثنا عبد
الملك بن أبي سليمان، عن عطاء، عن جابر بن عبد الله، قال شهدت مع رسول
الله صلى الله عليه وسلم الصلاة يوم العيد فبدأ بالصلاة قبل الخطبة
بغير أذان ولا إقامة ثم قام متوكئا على بلال فأمر</arabic-text>
<english-text>Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I observed prayer with
the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the 'Id day. He
commenced with prayer before the sermon without Adhan and Iqama. He
then stood up leaning on Bilal, and he commanded (them) to be on
guard (against evil for the sake of) Allah, and he exhorted (them)
on obedience to Him, and he preached to the people and admonished
them. He then walked on till he came to the women and preached to
them and admonished them, and asked them to give alms, for most of
them are the fuel for Hell. A woman having a dark spot on the cheek
stood up and said: Why is it so, Messenger of Allah? He said: For
you grumble often and show ingratitude to your spouse. And then
they began to give alms out of their ornaments such as their
earrings and rings which they threw on to the cloth of
Bilal.</english-text>
