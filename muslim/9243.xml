<arabic-text>وحدثنا ابن المثنى، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن مهدي، وأبو داود
قالا حدثنا شعبة، عن أبي إسحاق، قال سمعت البراء، يقول ‏.‏ فذكرا نحوه
غير أنهما قالا تنقز ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Abu Sa'id al-Khudri told of Usaid b. Hudair saying
that one night he recited the Qur'an in his enclosure, when the
horse began to jump about. He again recited and (the horse) again
jumped. He again recited and it jumped as before. Usaid said: I was
afraid lest it should trample (his son) Yahya. I stood near it (the
horse) and saw something like a canopy over my head with what
seemed to be lamps in it, rising up in the sky till it disappeared.
I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the
next day and said: Messenger of Allah, I recited the Qur'an during
the night in my enclosure and my horse began to jump. Upon this the
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: You should have
kept on reciting, Ibn Hudair. He (Ibn Hudair) said: I recited. It
jumped (as before). Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be
upon him) again said: You should have kept on reciting, Ibn Hudair.
He (Ibn Hudair) said: I recited and it again jumped (as before).
The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) again said: You
should kave kept on reciting, Ibu Hudair. He (Ibn Hudair) said:
(Messenger of Allah) I finished (the recitation) for Yahya was near
(the horse) and I was afraid lest it should trample him. I saw
something like a canopy with what seemed to be lamps in it rising
up in the sky till it disappeared. Upon this the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) said: Those were the angels who listened to
you; and if you had continued reciting, the people would have seen
them in the morning and they would not have concealed themselves
from them.</english-text>
