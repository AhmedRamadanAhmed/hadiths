<arabic-text>وحدثني عبد الله بن عبد الرحمن الدارمي، وأبو بكر بن
إسحاق قالا أخبرنا أبو اليمان، أخبرنا شعيب، عن الزهري، قال حدثني
عامر بن واثلة الليثي، أن نافع بن، عبد الحارث الخزاعي لقي عمر بن
الخطاب بعسفان ‏.‏ بمثل حديث إبراهيم بن سعد عن الزهري،
‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Umar b. Khattab said: I heard Hisham b. Hakim b.
Hizam reciting Surah al-Furqan in a style different from that in
which I used to recite it, and in which Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) had taught me to recite it. I was about to
dispute with him (on this style) but I delayed till he had finished
that (the recitation). Then I caught hold of his cloak and brought
him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said:
Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surah al-Furqan in a
style different from the one in which you taught me to recite. Upon
this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) told (me) to
leave him alone and asked him to recite. He then recited in the
style in which I beard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) then said: Thus was it sent down. He then told
me to recite and I recited it, and he said: Thus was it sent down.
The Qur'an was sent down in seven dialects. So recite what seems
easy therefrom.</english-text>
