<english-text>Abu Ubaid, the freed slave of Ibn Azhar, reported: I
observed Id along with Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with
him). He came (out in an open space) and prayed and (after)
completing it addressed the people and said: The Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) has forbidden the observing of fast on
these two days. One is the day of Fitr (at the end of your fasts),
and the second one, the day when you eat (the meat) of your
sacrifices.</english-text>
