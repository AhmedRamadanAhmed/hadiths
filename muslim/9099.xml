<arabic-text>وحدثنا أبو بكر بن أبي شيبة، حدثنا عبيد الله بن موسى،
عن حسن بن صالح، عن سماك، قال أخبرني جابر بن سمرة، أن النبي صلى الله
عليه وسلم لم يمت حتى صلى قاعدا ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Abdullah b. 'Amr reported: It was narrated to me
that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said: The
prayer observed by a person sitting is half of the prayer. I came
to him (may peace be upon him) and found him praying in a sitting
position. I placed my hand on his head. He said: O 'Abdullah b.
'Amr, what is the matter with you? I said: Messenger of Allah, it
has been narrated to me that you said: The prayer of a man in a
sitting position is half of the prayer, whereas you are observing
prayer sitting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes, it is so, but I am
not like anyone amongst you.</english-text>
