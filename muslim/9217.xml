<arabic-text>وحدثناه شيبان بن فروخ، حدثنا عبد الوارث، عن عبد
العزيز، عن أنس، عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم مثله ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Urwa b. Zubair reported that 'A'isha, the wife of
the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), told him that (once)
Haula' dint Tuwait b. Habib b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzzi passed by her
(at the time) when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
was with her. I ('A'Isha) said: It Is Haula' bint Tuwait and they
say that she does not sleep at night. Upon this the Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Oh) she does not sleep at
night! Choose an act which you are capable of doing (continuously).
By Allah, Allah would not grow weary, but you will grow
weary.</english-text>
