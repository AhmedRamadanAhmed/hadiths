<arabic-text>وحدثني محمد بن عبد الله بن بزيع، حدثنا يزيد، - يعني
ابن زريع - حدثنا حميد الطويل، حدثنا بكر بن عبد الله المزني، عن عروة
بن المغيرة بن شعبة، عن أبيه، قال تخلف رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
وتخلفت معه فلما قضى حاجته قال ‏"‏ أمعك ماء ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فأتيته بمطهرة
فغسل كفيه ووجهه ثم ذهب يحسر عن ذراعيه فضاق كم الجبة فأخرج يده من
تحت الجبة وألقى الجبة على منكبيه وغسل ذراعيه ومسح بناصيته وعلى
العمامة وعلى خفيه ثم ركب وركبت فانتهينا إلى القوم وقد قاموا في
الصلاة يصلي بهم عبد الرحمن بن عوف وقد ركع بهم ركعة فلما أحس بالنبي
صلى الله عليه وسلم ذهب يتأخر فأومأ إليه فصلى بهم فلما سلم قام النبي
صلى الله عليه وسلم وقمت فركعنا الركعة التي سبقتنا ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>'Urwa b. al Mughira b. Shu'ba reported it on the
authority of his father that he said: The Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) lagged behind (in a journey) and I also lagged
behind along with him. After having relieved himself he said: Have
you any water with you? I brought to him a jar of water; he washed
his palms, and face, and when he tried to get his forearms out (he
could not) for the sleeve of the gown was tight. He, therefore,
brought them out from under the gown and, throwing it over his
shoulders, he washed his forearm. He then wiped his forelock and
his turban and his socks. He then mounted and I also mounted (the
ride) and came to the people. They had begun the prayer with 'Abd
ar-Rabmin b. 'Anf leading them and had completed a rak'a. When he
perceived the presence of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon
him) he began to retire. He (the Holy Prophet) signed to him to
continue and offered prayer along with them. Then when he had
pronounced the salutation, the Apostle (may peace be upon him) got
up and I also got up with him, and we offered the rak'a which had
been finished before we came.</english-text>
