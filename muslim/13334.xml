<arabic-text>حدثني محمد بن سهل التميمي، حدثنا أبو اليمان، أخبرنا
شعيب، عن عبد الله، بن أبي حسين حدثنا نافع بن جبير، عن ابن عباس، قال
قدم مسيلمة الكذاب على عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم المدينة فجعل
يقول إن جعل لي محمد الأمر من بعده تبعته ‏.‏ فقدمها في بشر كثير من
قومه فأقبل إليه النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ومعه ثابت بن قيس بن شماس
وفي يد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قطعة جريدة حتى وقف على مسيلمة في
أصحابه قال ‏"‏ لو سألتني هذه القطعة ما أعطيتكها ولن أتعدى أمر الله
فيك ولئن أدبرت ليعقرنك الله وإني لأراك الذي أريت فيك ما أريت وهذا
ثابت يجيبك عني ‏"‏ ‏.‏ ثم انصرف عنه ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ibn Abbas reported that Musailima al-Kadhdhab (the
greater liar) (who claimed prophethood after the death of the Holy
Prophet) came during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle (may peace be
upon him) to Medina and said: If Muhammad assigns his caliphate to
me after him I would follow, and there came along with him a large
body of persons of his tribe and there came to him Allah's Apostle
(may peace be upon him) along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and
the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a piece of wood in
his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company of his
companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would
never give it to you. I am not going to do anything against the
will of God in your case, and if you turn away (from what I say)
Allah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I
was shown (in the dream) and here is Thabit and he would answer you
on my behalf. He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn 'Abbas
said: I asked the (meanings of the) words of Allah's Apostle (may
peace be upon him):" You are the same what I was made to see about
you in my dream." and Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger.
(may peace be upon him) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my
hands two gold bangles. This had a disturbing effect upon me and I
was given a suggestion in the sleep that I should blow over them,
so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted these
(two bangles) as the two great liars who would appear after me and
the one amongst them was 'Anasi the inhabitant of San'a' and the
other one Musailima the inhabitant of Yamama.</english-text>
