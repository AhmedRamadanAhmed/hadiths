<arabic-text>حدثنا إسحاق بن إبراهيم الحنظلي، وابن أبي عمر، ومحمد بن
رافع، وعبد بن، حميد - واللفظ لابن رافع - قال ابن رافع وابن أبي عمر
حدثنا وقال الآخران، أخبرنا عبد الرزاق، أخبرنا معمر، عن الزهري، عن
عبيد الله بن عبد الله بن عتبة، عن ابن عباس، أن أبا سفيان، أخبره من،
فيه إلى فيه قال انطلقت في المدة التي كانت بيني وبين رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم قال فبينا أنا بالشأم إذ جيء بكتاب من رسول الله صلى
الله عليه وسلم إلى هرقل يعني عظيم الروم - قال - وكان دحية الكلبي
جاء به فدفعه إلى عظيم بصرى فدفعه عظيم بصرى إلى هرقل فقال هرقل هل ها
هنا أحد من قوم هذا الرجل الذي يزعم أنه نبي قالوا نعم - قال - فدعيت
في نفر من قريش فدخلنا على هرقل فأجلسنا بين يديه فقال أيكم أقرب نسبا
من هذا الرجل الذي يزعم أنه نبي فقال أبو سفيان فقلت أنا ‏.‏ فأجلسوني
بين يديه وأجلسوا أصحابي خلفي ثم دعا بترجمانه فقال له قل لهم إني
سائل هذا عن الرجل الذي يزعم أنه نبي فإن كذبني فكذبوه ‏.‏ قال فقال
أبو سفيان وايم الله لولا مخافة أن يؤثر على الكذب لكذبت ‏.‏ ثم قال
لترجمانه سله كيف حسبه فيكم قال قلت هو فينا ذو حسب قال فهل كان من
آبائه ملك قلت لا ‏.‏ قال فهل كنتم تتهمونه بالكذب قبل أن يقول ما قال
قلت لا ‏.‏ قال ومن يتبعه أشراف الناس أم ضعفاؤهم قال قلت بل ضعفاؤهم
‏.‏ قال أيزيدون أم ينقصون قال قلت لا بل يزيدون ‏.‏ قال هل يرتد أحد
منهم عن دينه بعد أن يدخل فيه سخطة له قال قلت لا ‏.‏ قال فهل
قاتلتموه قلت نعم ‏.‏ قال فكيف كان قتالكم إياه قال قلت تكون الحرب
بيننا وبينه سجالا يصيب منا ونصيب منه ‏.‏ قال فهل يغدر قلت لا ‏.‏
ونحن منه في مدة لا ندري ما هو صانع فيها ‏.‏ قال فوالله ما أمكنني من
كلمة أدخل فيها شيئا غير هذه ‏.‏ قال فهل قال هذا القول أحد قبله قال
قلت لا ‏.‏ قال لترجمانه قل له إني سألتك عن حسبه فزعمت أنه فيكم ذو
حسب وكذلك الرسل تبعث في أحساب قومها ‏.‏ وسألتك هل كان في آبائه ملك
فزعمت أن لا ‏.‏ فقلت لو كان من آبائه ملك قلت رجل يطلب ملك آبائه ‏.‏
وسألتك عن أتباعه أضعفاؤهم أم أشرافهم فقلت بل ضعفاؤهم وهم أتباع
الرسل ‏.‏ وسألتك هل كنتم تتهمونه بالكذب قبل أن يقول ما قال فزعمت أن
لا ‏.‏ فقد عرفت أنه لم يكن ليدع الكذب على الناس ثم يذهب فيكذب على
الله ‏.‏ وسألتك هل يرتد أحد منهم عن دينه بعد أن يدخله سخطة له فزعمت
أن لا ‏.‏ وكذلك الإيمان إذا خالط بشاشة القلوب ‏.‏ وسألتك هل يزيدون
أو ينقصون فزعمت أنهم يزيدون وكذلك الإيمان حتى يتم ‏.‏ وسألتك هل
قاتلتموه فزعمت أنكم قد قاتلتموه فتكون الحرب بينكم وبينه سجالا ينال
منكم وتنالون منه ‏.‏ وكذلك الرسل تبتلى ثم تكون لهم العاقبة وسألتك
هل يغدر فزعمت أنه لا يغدر ‏.‏ وكذلك الرسل لا تغدر ‏.‏ وسألتك هل قال
هذا القول أحد قبله فزعمت أن لا ‏.‏ فقلت لو قال هذا القول أحد قبله
قلت رجل ائتم بقول قيل قبله ‏.‏ قال ثم قال بم يأمر كم قلت يأمرنا
بالصلاة والزكاة والصلة والعفاف قال إن يكن ما تقول فيه حقا فإنه نبي
وقد كنت أعلم أنه خارج ولم أكن أظنه منكم ولو أني أعلم أني أخلص إليه
لأحببت لقاءه ولو كنت عنده لغسلت عن قدميه وليبلغن ملكه ما تحت قدمى
‏.‏ قال ثم دعا بكتاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقرأه فإذا فيه
‏"‏ بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم من محمد رسول الله إلى هرقل عظيم الروم
سلام على من اتبع الهدى أما بعد فإني أدعوك بدعاية الإسلام أسلم تسلم
وأسلم يؤتك الله أجرك مرتين وإن توليت فإن عليك إثم الأريسيين و ‏{‏
يا أهل الكتاب تعالوا إلى كلمة سواء بيننا وبينكم أن لا نعبد إلا الله
ولا نشرك به شيئا ولا يتخذ بعضنا بعضا أربابا من دون الله فإن تولوا
فقولوا اشهدوا بأنا مسلمون‏}‏ فلما فرغ من قراءة الكتاب ارتفعت
الأصوات عنده وكثر اللغط وأمر بنا فأخرجنا ‏.‏ قال فقلت لأصحابي حين
خرجنا لقد أمر أمر ابن أبي كبشة إنه ليخافه ملك بني الأصفر - قال -
فما زلت موقنا بأمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه سيظهر حتى أدخل
الله على الإسلام ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas
who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter
said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of
truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the
Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The
letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor
of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the
letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who
thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called
along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to
Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has
closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu
Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my
companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to
him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu
Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells
me a lie, then refute him. Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God,
if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I
would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire
from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among
us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said:
No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed
his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people
of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He
asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No.
they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his
religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I
said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He
asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and
him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the
other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by
turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we
suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his
covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty
with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do
about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in
this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He
asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before
him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I
asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the
best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the
descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu
Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among
his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been
a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man
demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers
whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that
they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the
Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood
before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did
not. So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to
tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of
forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone
renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had
embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this
when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I
asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You
said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its
consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and
you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and
him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your
hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the
Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you
whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did
not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their
covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed
the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone
had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he
was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he
asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer
Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise
chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is
certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not
think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be
able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with
him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion
would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then
he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be
upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:" In the name of
Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the
Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be
upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the
invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe.
Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn
away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects." O People of the
Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should
worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to
Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other
than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to
our being Muslims [iii. 64]." When he hid finished the reading of
the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he
ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my
companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn
Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come
to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid
of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued me
with (the spirit of) Islam.</english-text>
