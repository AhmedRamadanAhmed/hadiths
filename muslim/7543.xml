<arabic-text>وحدثنيه إبراهيم بن سعيد الجوهري، حدثنا أبو أسامة، قال
حدثني بريد بن عبد الله، بهذا الإسناد قال سئل رسول الله صلى الله
عليه وسلم أى المسلمين أفضل فذكر مثله ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It is reported on the authority of Anas that the
Prophet of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him ) said: There
are three qualities for which anyone who is characterised by them
will relish the sweetness of faith: he to whom Allah and His
Messenger are dearer than all else; he who loves a man for Allah's
sake alone; and he who has as great an abhorrence of returning to
unbelief after Allah has rescued him from it as he has of being
cast into Hell.</english-text>
