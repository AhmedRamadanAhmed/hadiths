<arabic-text>وحدثني محمد بن سلمة المرادي، حدثنا عبد الله بن وهب، عن
عياض بن عبد الله الفهري، عن مخرمة بن سليمان، بهذا الإسناد وزاد ثم
عمد إلى شجب من ماء فتسوك وتوضأ وأسبغ الوضوء ولم يهرق من الماء إلا
قليلا ثم حركني فقمت ‏.‏ وسائر الحديث نحو حديث مالك
‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ibn Abbas reported: I slept (one night) in the house
of Maimuna, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon
him), and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was with her
that night. He (after sleeping for half of the night got up and)
then performed ablution and then stood up and observed prayer. I
too stood on his left side. He took hold of me and made me stand on
his right side. He (the Holy Prophet) observed thirteen rak'ahs on
that night. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then
slept and snored and it was a habit with him to snore while
sleeping. The Mu'adhdbin then came to him (to inform him about the
prayer). He then went out and observed prayer without performing
ablution. ('Amr said: Bukair b. Ashajj had narrated it to me
)</english-text>
