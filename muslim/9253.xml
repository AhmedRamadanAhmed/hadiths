<arabic-text>حدثنا هناد بن السري، ومنجاب بن الحارث التميمي، جميعا
عن علي بن مسهر، عن الأعمش، بهذا الإسناد ‏.‏ وزاد هناد في روايته قال
لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو على المنبر ‏"‏ اقرأ على ‏"‏
‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ibrahim reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace
be upon him) asked 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud to recite to him (the
Qur'an). He said: Should I recite it to you while it has been sent
down or revealed to you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: I love to hear
it from someone else. So he ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) recited to him
(from the beginning of Surat al Nisa' up to the verse:" How shall
then it be when We bring from every people a witness and bring you
as a witness against them?" He (the Holy Prophet) wept (on
listening to it). It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas'ud
through another chain of transmitters that the Apostle of Allah
(may peace be upon him) also said that he had been a witness to his
people as long as (said he): I lived among them or I had been among
them.</english-text>
