<arabic-text>وحدثناه عبد بن حميد، أخبرنا عبد الرزاق، أخبرنا معمر،
عن الزهري، بهذا الإسناد.</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ubayy b. Ka'b reported: I was in the mosque when a
man entered and prayed and recited (the Qur'in) in a style to which
I objected. Then another man entered (the mosque) and recited in a
style different from that of his companion. When we had finished
the prayer, we all went to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) and said to him: This man recited in a style to which I
objected, and the other entered and recited in a style different
from that of his companion. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be
upon him) asked them to recite and so they recited, and the Apostle
of Allah (may peace be upon him) expressed approval of their
affairs (their modes of recitation). and there occurred In my mind
a sort of denial which did not occur even during the Days of
Ignorance. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw
how I was affected (by a wrong idea), he struck my chest, whereupon
I broke into sweating and felt as though I were looking at Allah
with fear. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Ubayy. a message was
sent to me to recite the Qur'an in one dialect, and I replied: Make
(things) easy for my people. It was conveyed to me for the second
time that it should be recited in two dialects. I again replied to
him: Make affairs easy for my people. It was again conveyed to me
for the third time to recite in seven dialects And (I was further
told): You have got a seeking for every reply that I sent you,
which you should seek from Me. I said: O Allah! forgive my people,
forgive my people, and I have deferred the third one for the day on
which the entire creation will turn to me, including even Ibrahim
(peace be upon him) (for intercession).</english-text>
