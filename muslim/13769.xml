<arabic-text>وحدثني إبراهيم بن محمد بن عرعرة السامي، ومحمد بن حاتم،
- وتقاربا في سياق الحديث واللفظ لابن حاتم - قالا حدثنا عبد الرحمن
بن مهدي حدثنا المثنى بن سعيد عن أبي جمرة عن ابن عباس قال لما بلغ
أبا ذر مبعث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بمكة قال لأخيه اركب إلى هذا
الوادي فاعلم لي علم هذا الرجل الذي يزعم أنه يأتيه الخبر من السماء
فاسمع من قوله ثم ائتني ‏.‏ فانطلق الآخر حتى قدم مكة وسمع من قوله ثم
رجع إلى أبي ذر فقال رأيته يأمر بمكارم الأخلاق وكلاما ما هو بالشعر
‏.‏ فقال ما شفيتني فيما أردت ‏.‏ فتزود وحمل شنة له فيها ماء حتى قدم
مكة فأتى المسجد فالتمس النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ولا يعرفه وكره أن
يسأل عنه حتى أدركه - يعني الليل - فاضطجع فرآه علي فعرف أنه غريب
فلما رآه تبعه فلم يسأل واحد منهما صاحبه عن شىء حتى أصبح ثم احتمل
قريبته وزاده إلى المسجد فظل ذلك اليوم ولا يرى النبي صلى الله عليه
وسلم حتى أمسى فعاد إلى مضجعه فمر به علي فقال ما أنى للرجل أن يعلم
منزله فأقامه فذهب به معه ولا يسأل واحد منهما صاحبه عن شىء حتى إذا
كان يوم الثالث فعل مثل ذلك فأقامه علي معه ثم قال له ألا تحدثني ما
الذي أقدمك هذا البلد قال إن أعطيتني عهدا وميثاقا لترشدني فعلت ‏.‏
ففعل فأخبره فقال فإنه حق وهو رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فإذا
أصبحت فاتبعني فإني إن رأيت شيئا أخاف عليك قمت كأني أريق الماء فإن
مضيت فاتبعني حتى تدخل مدخلي ‏.‏ ففعل فانطلق يقفوه حتى دخل على النبي
صلى الله عليه وسلم ودخل معه فسمع من قوله وأسلم مكانه فقال له النبي
صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ ارجع إلى قومك فأخبرهم حتى يأتيك أمري ‏"‏ ‏.‏
فقال والذي نفسي بيده لأصرخن بها بين ظهرانيهم ‏.‏ فخرج حتى أتى
المسجد فنادى بأعلى صوته أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله
‏.‏ وثار القوم فضربوه حتى أضجعوه فأتى العباس فأكب عليه فقال ويلكم
ألستم تعلمون أنه من غفار وأن طريق تجاركم إلى الشام عليهم ‏.‏ فأنقذه
منهم ثم عاد من الغد بمثلها وثاروا إليه فضربوه فأكب عليه العباس
فأنقذه ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Ibn 'Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the
advent of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) in Mecca he said:
Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the
person who claims that there comes to him information from the
Heavens. Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on
until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of
the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have
seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his
expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said:
I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my
mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and
a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came
to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka'ba) and began to find out
Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise
him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask
about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. 'All saw
him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He
followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about
anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his
provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see
Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then
returned to his bed that there happened to pass 'Ali and he said:
This man has not been able to find his destination until this time.
He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry
from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he
did the same. 'Ali made him stand up and brought him along with
him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don't you
tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said:
(I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that
you would guide me aright. He then did that. He ('Ali) said:
Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be
upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say
anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in
a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then
follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed
him until he came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He
entered (the house) of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him)
along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his
very place. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go
to your people and inform them until my command reaches you.
Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to
the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set
forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his
voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god
but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people
attacked him and made him fall down when 'Abbas came and he leaned
over him and said: Woe be upon you, don't you know that he is from
amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria
passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him.
He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans)
again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued
him.</english-text>
