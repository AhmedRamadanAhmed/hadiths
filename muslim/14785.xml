حمص حدثني عبد الرحمن بن، جبير عن أبيه، جبير بن نفير الحضرمي أنه سمع

- حدثنا الوليد بن مسلم، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن يزيد بن جابر، عن يحيى
بن جابر الطائي، عن عبد الرحمن بن جبير بن، نفير عن أبيه، جبير بن
نفير عن النواس بن سمعان، قال ذكر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
الدجال ذات غداة فخفض فيه ورفع حتى ظنناه في طائفة النخل فلما رحنا
إليه عرف ذلك فينا فقال ‏"‏ ما شأنكم ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قلنا يا رسول الله ذكرت
الدجال غداة فخفضت فيه ورفعت حتى ظنناه في طائفة النخل ‏.‏ فقال ‏"‏
غير الدجال أخوفني عليكم إن يخرج وأنا فيكم فأنا حجيجه دونكم وإن يخرج
ولست فيكم فامرؤ حجيج نفسه والله خليفتي على كل مسلم إنه شاب قطط عينه
طافئة كأني أشبهه بعبد العزى بن قطن فمن أدركه منكم فليقرأ عليه فواتح
سورة الكهف إنه خارج خلة بين الشأم والعراق فعاث يمينا وعاث شمالا يا
عباد الله فاثبتوا ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قلنا يا رسول الله وما لبثه في الأرض قال
‏"‏ أربعون يوما يوم كسنة ويوم كشهر ويوم كجمعة وسائر أيامه كأيامكم
‏"‏ ‏.‏ قلنا يا رسول الله فذلك اليوم الذي كسنة أتكفينا فيه صلاة يوم
قال ‏"‏ لا اقدروا له قدره ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قلنا يا رسول الله وما إسراعه في
الأرض قال ‏"‏ كالغيث استدبرته الريح فيأتي على القوم فيدعوهم فيؤمنون
به ويستجيبون له فيأمر السماء فتمطر والأرض فتنبت فتروح عليهم سارحتهم
أطول ما كانت ذرا وأسبغه ضروعا وأمده خواصر ثم يأتي القوم فيدعوهم
فيردون عليه قوله فينصرف عنهم فيصبحون ممحلين ليس بأيديهم شىء من
أموالهم ويمر بالخربة فيقول لها أخرجي كنوزك ‏.‏ فتتبعه كنوزها
كيعاسيب النحل ثم يدعو رجلا ممتلئا شبابا فيضربه بالسيف فيقطعه جزلتين
رمية الغرض ثم يدعوه فيقبل ويتهلل وجهه يضحك فبينما هو كذلك إذ بعث
الله المسيح ابن مريم فينزل عند المنارة البيضاء شرقي دمشق بين
مهرودتين واضعا كفيه على أجنحة ملكين إذا طأطأ رأسه قطر وإذا رفعه
تحدر منه جمان كاللؤلؤ فلا يحل لكافر يجد ريح نفسه إلا مات ونفسه
ينتهي حيث ينتهي طرفه فيطلبه حتى يدركه بباب لد فيقتله ثم يأتي عيسى
ابن مريم قوم قد عصمهم الله منه فيمسح عن وجوههم ويحدثهم بدرجاتهم في
الجنة فبينما هو كذلك إذ أوحى الله إلى عيسى إني قد أخرجت عبادا لي لا
يدان لأحد بقتالهم فحرز عبادي إلى الطور ‏.‏ ويبعث الله يأجوج ومأجوج
وهم من كل حدب ينسلون فيمر أوائلهم على بحيرة طبرية فيشربون ما فيها
ويمر آخرهم فيقولون لقد كان بهذه مرة ماء ‏.‏ ويحصر نبي الله عيسى
وأصحابه حتى يكون رأس الثور لأحدهم خيرا من مائة دينار لأحدكم اليوم
فيرغب نبي الله عيسى وأصحابه فيرسل الله عليهم النغف في رقابهم
فيصبحون فرسى كموت نفس واحدة ثم يهبط نبي الله عيسى وأصحابه إلى الأرض
فلا يجدون في الأرض موضع شبر إلا ملأه زهمهم ونتنهم فيرغب نبي الله
عيسى وأصحابه إلى الله فيرسل الله طيرا كأعناق البخت فتحملهم فتطرحهم
حيث شاء الله ثم يرسل الله مطرا لا يكن منه بيت مدر ولا وبر فيغسل
الأرض حتى يتركها كالزلفة ثم يقال للأرض أنبتي ثمرتك وردي بركتك ‏.‏
فيومئذ تأكل العصابة من الرمانة ويستظلون بقحفها ويبارك في الرسل حتى
أن اللقحة من الإبل لتكفي الفئام من الناس واللقحة من البقر لتكفي
القبيلة من الناس واللقحة من الغنم لتكفي الفخذ من الناس فبينما هم
كذلك إذ بعث الله ريحا طيبة فتأخذهم تحت آباطهم فتقبض روح كل مؤمن وكل
مسلم ويبقى شرار الناس يتهارجون فيها تهارج الحمر فعليهم تقوم الساعة

<english-text>An-Nawwas b. Sam'an reported that Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the
morning. He sometimes described him to be insignificant and
sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt)
as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went
to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs
of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We
said: Allah's Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the
morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and
sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were
present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees.
Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other
things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I
shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while
I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and
Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard
him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with
twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to
'Abd-ul-'Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him
should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He
would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread
mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of
Truth). We said: Allah's Messenger, how long would he stay on the
earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day
like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would
be like your days. We said: Allah's Messenger, would one day's
prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon
he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then
observe prayer). We said: Allah's Messenger, how quickly would he
walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the
wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong
religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to
him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be
rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the
evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their
humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks
stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them.
But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there
would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in
the form of wealth. He would then walk through the waste, land and
say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come
out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He
would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with
the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at
a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target.
He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward
laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at
this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he
will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus
wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his
hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head,
there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he
would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every
non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and
his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would
then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at
the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had
protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their
faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would
be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these
words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people
against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people
safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they
would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the
lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them
would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his
companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be
so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to
them than one hundred dinirs and Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his
companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects
(which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would
perish like one single person. Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his
companions would then come down to the earth and they would not
find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not
filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah's Apostle, Jesus,
and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send
birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they
would carry them and throw them where God would will. Then Allah
would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels'
hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it
could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring
forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof,
there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons
would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and
milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able
to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity
of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that
and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family
would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would
send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their
armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the
wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the
Last Hour would come to them.</english-text>
