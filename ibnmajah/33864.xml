<arabic-text>حدثنا سهل بن أبي سهل، قال حدثنا معن بن عيسى، ح وحدثنا
محمد بن يحيى، حدثنا بشر بن عمر، قالا حدثنا مالك، عن ابن شهاب، عن
عروة، عن عائشة، أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان إذا اشتكى يقرأ على
نفسه المعوذات وينفث فلما اشتد وجعه كنت أقرأ عليه وأمسح بيده رجاء
بركتها ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It wasnarrated that Zainab said: “There was an old
woman who used toenter upon us and perform Ruqyah from erysipelas:
Contagious diseasewhich causes fever and leaves a red coloration of
the skin. We had abed with long legs, and when ‘Abdullah entered he
would clear histhroat and make noise. He entered one day and when
she heard hisvoice she veiled herself from him. He came and sat
beside me, andtouched me, and he found a sting. He said: ‘What is
this?’ Isaid: ‘An amulet against erysipelas.’ He pulled it, broke
it andthrew it away, and said: ‘The family of ‘Abdullah has no need
ofpolytheism.’ I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:
“Ruqyah(i.e., which consist of the names of idols and devils etc.),
amuletsand Tiwalah (charms) are polytheism.’”“I said: ‘I went out
one day and so-and-so looked at me, and my eye began to water on
the side nearest him. When I recited Ruqyah for it, it stopped, but
if I did not recite Ruqyah it watered again.’ He said: ‘That is
Satan, if you obey him he leaves you alone but if you disobey him
he pokes you with his finger in your eye. But if you do what the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do, that will be better for you and
more effective in healing. Sprinkle water in your eye and say:
Adhhibil-bas Rabban-nas, washfi Antash-Shafi, la shifa’a illa
shafi’uka, shafi’an la yughadiru saqaman (Take away the pain, O
Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and
there is no healing but Your healing that leaves no trace of
sickness).’”</english-text>
