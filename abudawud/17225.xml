<arabic-text>حدثنا شيبان بن فروخ، حدثنا محمد بن راشد، ح وحدثنا
الحسن بن علي، حدثنا يزيد بن هارون، أخبرنا محمد بن راشد، - وهو أشبع
- عن سليمان بن موسى، عن عمرو بن شعيب، عن أبيه، عن جده، قال إن النبي
صلى الله عليه وسلم قضى أن كل مستلحق استلحق بعد أبيه الذي يدعى له
ادعاه ورثته فقضى أن كل من كان من أمة يملكها يوم أصابها فقد لحق بمن
استلحقه وليس له مما قسم قبله من الميراث شىء وما أدرك من ميراث لم
يقسم فله نصيبه ولا يلحق إذا كان أبوه الذي يدعى له أنكره وإن كان من
أمة لم يملكها أو من حرة عاهر بها فإنه لا يلحق به ولا يرث وإن كان
الذي يدعى له هو ادعاه فهو ولد زنية من حرة كان أو أمة

<english-text>'Amr b. Shu'aib on his father's authority said that
his grandfather reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) decided regarding one who
was treated as a member of a family after the death of his father,
to whom he was attributed when the heirs said he was one of them,
that if he was the child of a slave-woman whom the father owned
when he had intercourse with her, he was included among those who
sought his inclusion, but received none of the inheritance which
was previously divided; he, however, received his portion of the
inheritance which had not already been divided; but if the father
to whom he was attributed had disowned him, he was not joined to
the heirs. If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did
not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit
intercourse, he was not joined to the heirs and did not inherit
even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed
paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother
was free or a slave.</english-text>
