جابر بن عبد الله، قال جيء بسارق إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال
‏"‏ اقتلوه ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فقالوا يا رسول الله إنما سرق ‏.‏ فقال ‏"‏ اقطعوه

يا رسول الله إنما سرق ‏.‏ فقال ‏"‏ اقطعوه ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال فقطع ثم جيء
به الثالثة فقال ‏"‏ اقتلوه ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فقالوا يا رسول الله إنما سرق ‏.‏

<english-text>Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah: A thief was brought to
the Prophet (ﷺ). He said: Kill him. The people said: He has
committed theft, Messenger of Allah! Then he said: Cut off his
hand. So his (right) hand was cut off. He was brought a second time
and he said: Kill him. The people said: He has committed theft,
Messenger of Allah! Then he said: Cut off his foot. So his (left)
foot was cut off. He was brought a third time and he said: Kill
him. The people said: He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah!
So he said: Cut off his hand. (So his (left) hand was cut off.) He
was brought a fourth time and he said: Kill him. The people said:
He has committed theft, Messenger of Allah! So he said: Cut off his
foot. So his (right) foot was cut off. He was brought a fifth time
and he said: Kill him. So we took him away and killed him. We then
dragged him and cast him into a well and threw stones over
him.</english-text>
