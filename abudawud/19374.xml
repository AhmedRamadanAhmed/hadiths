<arabic-text>حدثنا محمد بن سليمان الأنباري، حدثنا وكيع، عن هشام بن
سعد، قال حدثني يزيد بن نعيم بن هزال، عن أبيه، قال كان ماعز بن مالك
يتيما في حجر أبي ‏.‏ فأصاب جارية من الحى فقال له أبي ائت رسول الله
صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره بما صنعت لعله يستغفر لك وإنما يريد بذلك
رجاء أن يكون له مخرجا فأتاه فقال يا رسول الله إني زنيت فأقم على
كتاب الله ‏.‏ فأعرض عنه فعاد فقال يا رسول الله إني زنيت فأقم على
كتاب الله ‏.‏ حتى قالها أربع مرار ‏.‏ قال صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏
إنك قد قلتها أربع مرات فبمن ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال بفلانة ‏.‏ قال ‏"‏ هل
ضاجعتها ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال نعم ‏.‏ قال ‏"‏ هل باشرتها ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال نعم ‏.‏
قال ‏"‏ هل جامعتها ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قال نعم ‏.‏ قال فأمر به أن يرجم فأخرج به
إلى الحرة ‏.‏ فلما رجم فوجد مس الحجارة جزع فخرج يشتد فلقيه عبد الله
بن أنيس وقد عجز أصحابه فنزع له بوظيف بعير فرماه به فقتله ثم أتى
النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فذكر ذلك له فقال ‏"‏ هلا تركتموه لعله أن
يتوب فيتوب الله عليه ‏"‏ ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Nu'aym ibn Huzzal: Yazid ibn Nu'aym ibn
Huzzal, on his father's authority said: Ma'iz ibn Malik was an
orphan under the protection of my father. He had illegal sexual
intercourse with a slave-girl belonging to a clan. My father said
to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and inform him of what you
have done, for he may perhaps ask Allah for your forgiveness. His
purpose in that was simply a hope that it might be a way of escape
for him. So he went to him and said: Messenger of Allah! I have
committed fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by
Allah. He (the Prophet) turned away from him, so he came back and
said: Messenger of Allah! I have committed fornication, so inflict
on me the punishment ordained by Allah. He (again) turned away from
him, so he came back and said: Messenger of Allah! I have committed
fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah.
When he uttered it four times, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You
have said it four times. With whom did you commit it? He replied:
With so and so. He asked: Did you lie down with her? He replied:
Yes. He asked: Had your skin been in contact with hers? He replied.
Yes. He asked: Did you have intercourse with her? He said: Yes. So
he (the Prophet) gave orders that he should be stoned to death. He
was then taken out to the Harrah, and while he was being stoned he
felt the effect of the stones and could not bear it and fled. But
Abdullah ibn Unays encountered him when those who had been stoning
him could not catch up with him. He threw the bone of a camel's
foreleg at him, which hit him and killed him. They then went to the
Prophet (ﷺ) and reported it to him. He said: Why did you not leave
him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by
Allah.</english-text>
