<english-text>Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri narrated that the Prophet
(s.a.w) said: "The first batch to enter Paradise will appear like
the moon of a night that is full. The second will appear like the
color of the most beautiful star in the sky. Each man among them
shall have two wives, each wife wearing seventy bracelets, with the
marrow of their shins being visible from behind
them."</english-text>
