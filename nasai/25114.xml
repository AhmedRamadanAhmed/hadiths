<arabic-text>أخبرنا علي بن حجر، قال أنبأنا إسماعيل، قال حدثنا يحيى
بن علي بن يحيى بن خلاد بن رفاعة بن رافع الزرقي، عن أبيه، عن جده، عن
رفاعة بن رافع، أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بينا هو جالس في صف
الصلاة الحديث ‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It was narrated from Rifa'ah bin Rafi' that while the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was sitting in the row for prayer. The
Hadith. [1][1]With this chain, At-Tirmidhi recorded it (No. 302)
and An-Nasai in Al-Kubra (No. 1631). It is the narration about the
man who prayed incorrectly, and in it, the Prophet instructed him:
"Then Tashhad, then say the Iqamah." And they say that the meaning
of Tashhad here is call the Adhan. An-Nasai recorded the Hadith
with different chains (1054, 1137, 1314,1315). Whereas the wording
narrated by At- Tirmidhi, and the author in Al-Kubra, mentions what
the author mentioned in the chapter, the other cited versions that
An-Nasai in this hook quoted do not. So it is as if he narrated the
chain here for Hadith, indicating the same version that At-Tirmidhi
narrated, and he himself in Al-Kubra, but he did not want to
narrate the actual text here. Abu Dawud also narrated it with the
order for the Adhan and Iqamah, through a different route of
transmission (No. 861). And it is among the proofs used for the
view that the Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory - since it has been
ordered in the Hadith of the one who prayed
incorrectly.</english-text>
