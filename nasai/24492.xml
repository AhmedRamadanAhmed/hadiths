<arabic-text>أخبرنا هناد بن السري، والحسين بن حريث، عن أبي أسامة،
عن الوليد بن كثير، عن محمد بن جعفر، عن عبد الله بن عبد الله بن عمر،
عن أبيه، قال سئل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عن الماء وما ينوبه من
الدواب والسباع ‏.‏ فقال ‏"‏ إذا كان الماء قلتين لم يحمل الخبث ‏"‏
‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah bin
'Umar that his father said: "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was asked
about water and how some animals and carnivorous beasts might drink
from it. He said: 'If the water is more than two Qullahs, it will
not carry filth.'"[1][1]It comes with some explanation in Sunan At
Timidhi 'Abdah (one of the narrators) said: "Muhammad bin Ishaq
said: 'A Qullah refers to Jirar (These are two nouns describing
large casks that are used to hold water), and a Qullah is the thing
that drinking water is held in."' At-Tirmidhi said: "This is the
saying of Ash Shafa'i, Ahmad and Ishaq. They say that when the
water is two Qullahs then nothing makes it impure, as long as it
does not change its smell, and its taste. And they say, it is
approximately fifty Qirbahs (waterskins)."</english-text>
