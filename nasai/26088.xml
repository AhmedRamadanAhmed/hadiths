وبقية، قالا حدثنا ابن أبي حمزة، قال حدثني الزهري، قال أخبرني عبيد

عن أبيه، وكان، قد شهد بدرا</arabic-text>
<english-text>It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Khabbab bin
Al-Aratt, from his father who had been present at Badr with the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that: He watched the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
one night when he prayed all night until Fajr time. When the
Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said the taslim at the end of his prayer,
Khabbab said to him: 'May my father and mother be ransomed for you
O Messenger of Allah, last night you offered a prayer the like of
which I have never seen you offer." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)
said: "Yes indeed. This is a prayer of hope and fear in which I
asked my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, for three things, of which
He gave me two and did not grant me one. I asked my Lord not to
destroy us with which he destroyed the nations before us, and He
granted me that. And I asked my Lord not to let an enemy from
without prevail over us, and He granted me that. And I asked my
Lord not to divide us into warring factions and He did not grant me
that."</english-text>
