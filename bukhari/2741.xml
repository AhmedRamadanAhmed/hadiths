<arabic-text>حدثنا محمد بن أبي بكر، حدثنا فضيل بن سليمان، عن أبي
حازم، عن عبد الله بن أبي قتادة، عن أبيه، أنه خرج مع النبي صلى الله
عليه وسلم فتخلف أبو قتادة مع بعض أصحابه وهم محرمون وهو غير محرم،
فرأوا حمارا وحشيا قبل أن يراه، فلما رأوه تركوه حتى رآه أبو قتادة،
فركب فرسا له يقال له الجرادة، فسألهم أن يناولوه سوطه فأبوا، فتناوله
فحمل فعقره، ثم أكل فأكلوا، فندموا فلما أدركوه قال ‏"‏ هل معكم منه
شىء ‏"‏‏.‏ قال معنا رجله، فأخذها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم
فأكلها‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada: (from his father)
Abu Qatada went out (on a journey) with Allah's Apostle but he was
left behind with some of his companions who were in the state of
Ihram. He himself was not in the state of Ihram. They saw an opener
before he could see it. When they saw the opener, they did not
speak anything till Abu Qatada saw it. So, he rode over his horse
called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they
refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and
slaughtered it. He ate of its meat and his companions ate, too, but
they regretted their eating. When they met the Prophet (they asked
him about it) and he asked, "Have you some of its meat (left) with
you?" Abu Qatada replied, "Yes, we have its leg with us." So, the
Prophet took and ate it.</english-text>
