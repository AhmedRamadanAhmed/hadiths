<arabic-text>حدثنا عبد الله بن يوسف، أخبرنا مالك، عن حميد الطويل،
عن أنس رضى الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أتى خيبر ليلا،
وكان إذا أتى قوما بليل لم يغر بهم حتى يصبح، فلما أصبح خرجت اليهود
بمساحيهم ومكاتلهم، فلما رأوه قالوا محمد والله، محمد والخميس، فقال
النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ خربت خيبر، إنا إذا نزلنا بساحة قوم
فساء صباح المنذرين ‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Anas: Allah's Apostle reached Khaibar at
night and it was his habit that, whenever he reached the enemy at
night, he will not attack them till it was morning. When it was
morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when
they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, "Muhammad! By Allah!
Muhammad and his army!" The Prophet said, "Khaibar is destroyed,
for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil
will be the morning for those who have been warned." Narrated Anas
bin Malik: We reached Khaibar early in the morning and the
inhabitants of Khaibar came out carrying their spades, and when
they saw the Prophet they said, "Muhammad! By Allah! Muhammad and
his army!" The Prophet said, "Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed,
for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil
will be the morning for those who have been warned." We then got
the meat of donkeys (and intended to eat it), but an announcement
was made by the announcer of the Prophet, "Allah and His Apostle
forbid you to eat the meat of donkeys as it is an impure
thing."</english-text>
