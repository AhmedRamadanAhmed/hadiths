<arabic-text>حدثني محمد بن عبد الله الأنصاري، قال حدثني أبي، عن
ثمامة، عن أنس، أن أبا بكر رضى الله عنه لما استخلف كتب له، وكان نقش
الخاتم ثلاثة أسطر‏.‏ محمد سطر، ورسول سطر، والله
سطر‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Anas: that when Abu Bakr became the Caliph,
he wrote a letter to him (and stamped it with the Prophet's ring)
and the engraving of the ring was in three lines: Muhammad in one
line, 'Apostle' in another line, and 'Allah' in a third line. Anas
added: 'the ring of the Prophet was in his hand, and after him, in
Abu Bakr's hand, and then in `Umar's hand after Abu Bakr. When
`Uthman was the Caliph, once he was sitting at the well of Aris. He
removed the ring from his hand and while he was trifling with it,
dropped into the well. We kept on going to the well with `Uthman
for three days looking for the ring, and finally the well was
drained, but the ring was not found.</english-text>
