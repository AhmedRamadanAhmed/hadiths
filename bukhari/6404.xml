<arabic-text>حدثنا سعيد بن أبي مريم، حدثنا محمد بن مطرف، حدثني أبو
حازم، عن سهل بن سعد، قال قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ إني فرطكم
على الحوض، من مر على شرب، ومن شرب لم يظمأ أبدا، ليردن على أقوام
أعرفهم ويعرفوني، ثم يحال بيني وبينهم ‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d: The Prophet
said, "I am your predecessor (forerunner) at the Lake-Fount, and
whoever will pass by there, he will drink from it and whoever will
drink from it, he will never be thirsty. There will come to me some
people whom I will recognize, and they will recognize me, but a
barrier will be placed between me and them." Abu Hazim added:
An-Nu`man bin Abi `Aiyash, on hearing me, said. "Did you hear this
from Sahl?" I said, "Yes." He said, " I bear witness that I heard
Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri saying the same, adding that the Prophet said:
'I will say: They are of me (i.e. my followers). It will be said,
'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion
after you left'. I will say, 'Far removed, far removed (from
mercy), those who changed (their religion) after me." Abu Huraira
narrated that the Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection a group
of companions will come to me, but will be driven away from the
Lake-Fount, and I will say, 'O Lord (those are) my companions!' It
will be said, 'You have no knowledge as to what they innovated
after you left; they turned apostate as renegades (reverted from
Islam).</english-text>
