<arabic-text>حدثنا حفص بن عمر، حدثنا شعبة، أخبرنا عاصم الأحول، سمعت
أبا عثمان، يحدث عن أسامة، أن ابنة لرسول الله، صلى الله عليه وسلم
أرسلت إليه ومع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أسامة بن زيد وسعد وأبى
أن ابني قد احتضر فاشهدنا‏.‏ فأرسل يقرأ السلام ويقول ‏"‏ إن لله ما
أخذ وما أعطى وكل شىء عنده مسمى فلتصبر وتحتسب ‏"‏‏.‏ فأرسلت إليه
تقسم عليه، فقام وقمنا معه، فلما قعد رفع إليه، فأقعده في حجره ونفس
الصبي تقعقع، ففاضت عينا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال سعد ما
هذا يا رسول الله قال ‏"‏ هذا رحمة يضعها الله في قلوب من يشاء من
عباده، وإنما يرحم الله من عباده الرحماء ‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Usama: Once a daughter of Allah's Apostle
sent a message to Allah's Apostle while Usama, Sa`d, and my father
or Ubai were (sitting there) with him. She said, (in the message);
My child is going to die; please come to us." Allah's Apostle
returned the messenger and told him to convey his greetings to her,
and say, "Whatever Allah takes, is for Him and whatever He gives is
for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this
world): so she should be patient and hope for Allah's reward." Then
she again sent for him swearing that he should come; so The Prophet
got up, and so did we. When he sat there (at the house of his
daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took him into his
lap while the child's breath was disturbed in his chest. The eyes
of Allah's Apostle started shedding tears. Sa`d said, "What is
this, O Allah's Apostle?" The Prophet said, "This is the mercy
which Allah has lodged in the hearts of whoever He wants of His
slaves, and verily Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves
who are merciful (to others).'</english-text>
