<arabic-text>حدثنا أحمد، حدثنا ابن وهب، عن عمرو، عن ابن أبي هلال،
قال وأخبرني نافع، أن ابن عمر، أخبره أنه، وقف على جعفر يومئذ وهو
قتيل، فعددت به خمسين بين طعنة وضربة، ليس منها شىء في دبره‏.‏ يعني
في ظهره‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Nafi`: Ibn `Umar informed me that on the day
(of Mu'tah) he stood beside Ja`far who was dead (i.e. killed in the
battle), and he counted fifty wounds in his body, caused by stabs
or strokes, and none of those wounds was in his back. `Abdullah bin
`Umar said, "Allah's Apostle appointed Zaid bin Haritha as the
commander of the army during the Ghazwa of Mu'tah and said, "If
Zaid is martyred, Ja`far should take over his position, and if
Ja`far is martyred, `Abdullah bin Rawaha should take over his
position.' " `Abdulla-h bin `Umar further said, "I was present
amongst them in that battle and we searched for Ja`far bin Abi
Talib and found his body amongst the bodies of the martyred ones,
and found over ninety wounds over his body, caused by stabs or
shots (of arrows).</english-text>
