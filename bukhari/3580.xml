<arabic-text>فقصتها حفصة على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال ‏"‏ نعم
الرجل عبد الله، لو كان يصلي بالليل ‏"‏‏.‏ قال سالم فكان عبد الله لا
ينام من الليل إلا قليلا‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Ibn `Umar: If a man saw a dream during the
lifetime of the Prophet he would narrate it to the Prophet. Once I
wished to see a dream and narrate it to the Prophet I was young,
unmarried, and used to sleep in the Mosque during the lifetime of
the Prophet. I dreamt that two angels took me and went away with me
towards the (Hell) Fire which looked like a well with the inside
walls built up, and had two side-walls like those of a well. There
I saw some people in it whom I knew. I started saying, "I seek
Refuge with Allah from the (Hell) Fire, I seek Refuge with Allah
from the (Hell) Fire." Then another angel met the other two and
said to me, "Do not be afraid." I narrated my dream to Hafsa who,
in her turn, narrated it to the Prophet. He said, "What an
excellent man `Abdullah is if he only observes the night prayer."
(Salem, a sub-narrator said, "Abdullah used not to sleep at night
but very little hence forward."</english-text>
