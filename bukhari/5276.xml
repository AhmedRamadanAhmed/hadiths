<arabic-text>قال يحيى سمعت بشيرا، يقول حدثنا سويد، خرجنا مع رسول
الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى خيبر، فلما كنا بالصهباء قال يحيى وهى من
خيبر على روحة دعا بطعام فما أتي إلا بسويق، فلكناه فأكلنا معه، ثم
دعا بماء فمضمض ومضمضنا معه، ثم صلى بنا المغرب ولم يتوضأ‏.‏ وقال
سفيان كأنك تسمعه من يحيى‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Suwaid bin An Nu`man: We went out with
Allah's Apostle to Khaibar, and when we reached As-Sahba', the
Prophet asked for food, and he was offered nothing but Sawiq. We
ate, and then Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer. He rinsed
his mouth with water, and we too, rinsed our mouths. Narrated
Suwaid; We went out with Allah's Apostle to Khaibar. and when we
reached As-Sahba', which (Yahya says) is one day' journey from
Khaibar, the Prophet asked for food, and he was offered nothing but
Sawiq which we chewed and ate. Then the Prophet asked for water and
rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our mouths along with him. He
then led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution
again.</english-text>
