<english-text>Narrated 'Ata: Jabir said, "The Prophet ordered `Ali
to keep the state of Ihram." Jabir added, "Ali bin Abi Talib
returned (from Yemen) when he was a governor (of Yemen). The
Prophet said to him, 'With what intention have you assumed the
state of Ihram?' `Ali said, "I have assumed Ihram with an intention
as that of the Prophet." Then the Prophet said (to him), 'Offer a
Hadi and keep the state of Ihram in which you are now.' `Ali
slaughtered a Hadi on his behalf."</english-text>
