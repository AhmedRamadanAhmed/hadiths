<arabic-text>حدثنا إسماعيل، حدثني ابن وهب، عن عمرو، عن بكير، عن بسر
بن سعيد، عن جنادة بن أبي أمية، قال دخلنا على عبادة بن الصامت وهو
مريض قلنا أصلحك الله حدث بحديث، ينفعك الله به سمعته من النبي، صلى
الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ قال دعانا النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم
فبايعناه</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Junada bin Abi Umaiya: We entered upon
'Ubada bin As-Samit while he was sick. We said, "May Allah make you
healthy. Will you tell us a Hadith you heard from the Prophet and
by which Allah may make you benefit?" He said, "The Prophet called
us and we gave him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam, and among
the conditions on which he took the Pledge from us, was that we
were to listen and obey (the orders) both at the time when we were
active and at the time when we were tired, and at our difficult
time and at our ease and to be obedient to the ruler and give him
his right even if he did not give us our right, and not to fight
against him unless we noticed him having open Kufr (disbelief) for
which we would have a proof with us from Allah."</english-text>
