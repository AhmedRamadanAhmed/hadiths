<arabic-text>حدثنا عبد الله بن يوسف، أخبرنا مالك، عن إسحاق بن عبد
الله بن أبي طلحة، أنه سمع أنس بن مالك، يقول كان رسول الله صلى الله
عليه وسلم يدخل على أم حرام بنت ملحان، وكانت تحت عبادة بن الصامت،
فدخل عليها يوما فأطعمته، وجعلت تفلي رأسه، فنام رسول الله صلى الله
عليه وسلم ثم استيقظ وهو يضحك‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Apostle used to
visit Um Haram bint Milhan she was the wife of 'Ubada bin As-Samit.
One day the Prophet visited her and she provided him with food and
started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah's Apostle slept
and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, "What makes you
smile, O Allah's Apostle?" He said, "Some of my followers were
presented before me in my dream as fighters in Allah's Cause,
sailing in the middle of the seas like kings on the thrones or like
kings sitting on their thrones." (The narrator 'Is-haq is not sure
as to which expression was correct). Um Haram added, 'I said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah, to make me one of them;" So Allah's
Apostle invoked Allah for her and then laid his head down (and
slept). Then he woke up smiling (again). (Um Haram added): I said,
"What makes you smile, O Allah's Apostle?" He said, "Some people of
my followers were presented before me (in a dream) as fighters in
Allah's Cause." He said the same as he had said before. I said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me from them." He said, "You
are among the first ones." Then Um Haram sailed over the sea during
the Caliphate of Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan, and she fell down from her
riding animal after coming ashore, and died.</english-text>
