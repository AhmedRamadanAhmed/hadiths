<arabic-text>حدثنا مسلم بن إبراهيم، حدثنا جرير بن حازم، عن محمد بن
سيرين، عن أبي هريرة رضى الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم ‏"‏ كان رجل في بني إسرائيل، يقال له جريج، يصلي، فجاءته أمه
فدعته، فأبى أن يجيبها، فقال أجيبها أو أصلي ثم أتته، فقالت اللهم لا
تمته حتى تريه المومسات‏.‏ وكان جريج في صومعته، فقالت امرأة لأفتنن
جريجا‏.‏ فتعرضت له فكلمته فأبى، فأتت راعيا، فأمكنته من نفسها فولدت
غلاما، فقالت هو من جريج‏.‏ فأتوه، وكسروا صومعته فأنزلوه وسبوه،
فتوضأ وصلى ثم أتى الغلام، فقال من أبوك يا غلام قال الراعي‏.‏ قالوا
نبني صومعتك من ذهب‏.‏ قال لا إلا من طين ‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, "There
was an Israeli man called Juraij, while he was praying, his mother
came and called him, but he did not respond to her call. He said
(to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or reply to his
mother. She came to him the second time and called him and said, "O
Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes."
Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would
entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an
evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed
him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she
gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The
people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out
of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer,
then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; "O boy! Who is your
father?" The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The
people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but
Juraij asked them to make it of mud only."</english-text>
