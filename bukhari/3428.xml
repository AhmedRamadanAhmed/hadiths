<arabic-text>حدثنا عبد الله بن منير، سمع يزيد، أخبرنا حميد، عن أنس
رضى الله عنه قال حضرت الصلاة فقام من كان قريب الدار من المسجد
يتوضأ، وبقي قوم، فأتي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بمخضب من حجارة فيه
ماء، فوضع كفه فصغر المخضب أن يبسط فيه كفه، فضم أصابعه فوضعها في
المخضب، فتوضأ القوم كلهم جميعا‏.‏ قلت كم كانوا قال ثمانون
رجلا‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Humaid: Anas bin Malik said, "Once the time
of the prayer became due and the people whose houses were close to
the Mosque went to their houses to perform ablution, while the
others remained (sitting there). A stone pot containing water was
brought to the Prophet, who wanted to put his hand in it, but It
was too small for him to spread his hand in it, and so he had to
bring his fingers together before putting his hand in the pot. Then
all the people performed the ablution (with that water)." I asked
Anas, "How many persons were they." He replied, "There were eighty
men."</english-text>
