<arabic-text>حدثنا إبراهيم بن موسى، أخبرنا هشام، عن ابن جريج، وقال،
عطاء عن ابن عباس، كان المشركون على منزلتين من النبي صلى الله عليه
وسلم والمؤمنين، كانوا مشركي أهل حرب يقاتلهم ويقاتلونه، ومشركي أهل
عهد لا يقاتلهم ولا يقاتلونه، وكان إذا هاجرت امرأة من أهل الحرب لم
تخطب حتى تحيض وتطهر، فإذا طهرت حل لها النكاح، فإن هاجر زوجها قبل أن
تنكح ردت إليه، وإن هاجر عبد منهم أو أمة فهما حران ولهما ما
للمهاجرين‏.‏ ثم ذكر من أهل العهد مثل حديث مجاهد وإن هاجر عبد أو أمة
للمشركين أهل العهد لم يردوا، وردت أثمانهم‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The pagans were of two kinds as
regards their relationship to the Prophet and the Believers. Some
of them were those with whom the Prophet was at war and used to
fight against, and they used to fight him; the others were those
with whom the Prophet made a treaty, and neither did the Prophet
fight them, nor did they fight him. If a lady from the first group
of pagans emigrated towards the Muslims, her hand would not be
asked in marriage unless she got the menses and then became clean.
When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to get married,
and if her husband emigrated too before she got married, then she
would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave emigrated
from them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free
persons (not slaves) and they would have the same rights as given
to other emigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the pagans
involved with the Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in
Mujahid's narration. If a male slave or a female slave emigrated
from such pagans as had made a treaty with the Muslims, they would
not be returned, but their prices would be paid (to the
pagans).</english-text>
