<arabic-text>حدثنا علي، حدثنا سفيان، قال عمرو كان ها هنا رجل اسمه
نواس، وكانت عنده إبل هيم، فذهب ابن عمر رضى الله عنهما فاشترى تلك
الإبل من شريك له، فجاء إليه شريكه فقال بعنا تلك الإبل‏.‏ فقال ممن
بعتها قال من شيخ، كذا وكذا‏.‏ فقال ويحك ذاك والله ابن عمر‏.‏ فجاءه
فقال إن شريكي باعك إبلا هيما، ولم يعرفك‏.‏ قال فاستقها‏.‏ قال فلما
ذهب يستاقها فقال دعها، رضينا بقضاء رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لا
عدوى‏.‏ سمع سفيان عمرا‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated `Amr: Here (i.e. in Mecca) there was a man
called Nawwas and he had camels suffering from the disease of
excessive and unquenchable thirst. Ibn `Umar went to the partner of
Nawwas and bought those camels. The man returned to Nawwas and told
him that he had sold those camels. Nawwas asked him, "To whom have
you sold them?" He replied, "To such and such Sheikh." Nawwas said,
"Woe to you; By Allah, that Sheikh was Ibn `Umar." Nawwas then went
to Ibn `Umar and said to him, "My partner sold you camels suffering
from the disease of excessive thirst and he had not known you." Ibn
`Umar told him to take them back. When Nawwas went to take them,
Ibn `Umar said to him, "Leave them there as I am happy with the
decision of Allah's Apostle that there is no oppression .
