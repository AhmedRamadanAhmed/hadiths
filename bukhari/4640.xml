<arabic-text>حدثنا يحيى، حدثنا وكيع، عن الأعمش، عن أبي الضحى، عن
مسروق، قال دخلت على عبد الله فقال إن من العلم أن تقول لما لا تعلم
الله أعلم، إن الله قال لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏{‏قل ما أسألكم
عليه من أجر وما أنا من المتكلفين‏}‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated `Abdullah: It is a sign of having knowledge
that, when you do not know something, you say: 'Allah knows
better.' Allah said to his Prophet: 'Say: No wage do I ask of you
for this (Qur'an), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who
pretends things which do not exist)' (38.86) When the Quraish
troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, "O Allah! Help me
against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the
seven years of Joseph." So they were stricken with a year of famine
during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much
suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between
him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove
the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it
was said to the Prophet (by Allah), "If we remove it from them.
they will revert to their ways (of heathenism)." So the Prophet
invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later
they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the
day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah's Statement
indicates: 'Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a
kind of smoke plainly visible...we will indeed (then) exact
retribution.' (44.10).</english-text>
