<english-text>Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid and Majammi bin
Yazid: The same ,Hadith above: A man called Khidam married a
daughter of his (to somebody) against her consent. 'If you fear
that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls
then marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) And if somebody
says to the guardian (of a woman), "Marry me to soand- so," and the
guardian remained silent or said to him, "What have you got?" And
the other said, "I have so much and so much (Mahr)," or kept quiet,
and then the guardian said, "I have married her to you," then the
marriage is valid (legal). This narration was told by Sahl on the
authority of the Prophet.</english-text>
