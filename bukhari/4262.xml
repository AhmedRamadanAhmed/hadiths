<arabic-text>حدثنا سعيد بن عفير، قال حدثني الليث، قال حدثني عقيل،
عن ابن شهاب، قال أخبرني عبيد الله بن عبد الله بن عتبة بن مسعود، أن
عائشة، زوج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قالت لما ثقل رسول الله صلى الله
عليه وسلم واشتد به وجعه استأذن أزواجه أن يمرض في بيتي، فأذن له،
فخرج وهو بين الرجلين تخط رجلاه في الأرض، بين عباس بن عبد المطلب
وبين رجل آخر‏.‏ قال عبيد الله فأخبرت عبد الله بالذي قالت عائشة،
فقال لي عبد الله بن عباس هل تدري من الرجل الآخر الذي لم تسم عائشة
قال قلت لا‏.‏ قال ابن عباس هو علي‏.‏ وكانت عائشة زوج النبي صلى الله
عليه وسلم تحدث أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لما دخل بيتي واشتد
به وجعه قال ‏"‏ هريقوا على من سبع قرب لم تحلل أوكيتهن لعلي أعهد إلى
الناس ‏"‏‏.‏ فأجلسناه في مخضب لحفصة زوج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم،
ثم طفقنا نصب عليه من تلك القرب، حتى طفق يشير إلينا بيده أن قد فعلتن
قالت ثم خرج إلى الناس فصلى لهم وخطبهم‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) "When the
ailment of Allah's Apostle became aggravated, he requested his
wives to permit him to be (treated) nursed in my house, and they
gave him permission. He came out (to my house), walking between two
men with his feet dragging on the ground, between `Abbas bin
`Abdul--Muttalib and another man" 'Ubaidullah said, "I told
`Abdullah of what `Aisha had said, `Abdullah bin `Abbas said to me,
'Do you know who is the other man whom `Aisha did not name?' I
said, 'No.' Ibn `Abbas said, 'It was `Ali bin Abu Talib." `Aisha,
the wife of the Prophet used to narrate saying, "When Allah's
Apostle entered my house and his disease became aggravated, he
said, " Pour on me the water of seven water skins, the mouths of
which have not been untied, so that I may give advice to the
people.' So we let him sit in a big basin belonging to Hafsa, the
wife of the Prophet and then started to pour water on him from
these water skins till he started pointing to us with his hands
intending to say, 'You have done your job." `Aisha added, "Then he
went out to the people and led them in prayer and preached to
them." `Aisha and `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, "When Allah's Apostle
became ill seriously, he started covering his face with his woolen
sheet, and when he felt short of breath, he removed it from hi;
face and said, 'That is so! Allah's (curse be on the Jews and the
Christians, as they took the graves of their prophets as (places of
worship),' intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had done."
`Aisha added, "I argued with Allah's Apostle repeatedly about that
matter (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in
prayer in his place when he was ill), and what made me argue so
much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after the
Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place,
and I felt that anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen
to the people, so I wanted Allah's Apostle to give up the idea of
choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer).</english-text>
