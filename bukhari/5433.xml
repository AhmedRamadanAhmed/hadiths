<arabic-text>حدثنا أبو عاصم، عن الأوزاعي، عن ابن شهاب، عن عبيد الله
بن عبد الله، عن ابن عباس رضى الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم شرب لبنا فمضمض وقال ‏"‏ إن له دسما ‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Allah's Apostle drank milk and
then rinsed his mouth and said, "It contains fat. The Prophet
added: I was raised to the Lote Tree and saw four rivers, two of
which were coming out and two going in. Those which were coming out
were the Nile and the Euphrates, and those which were going in were
two rivers in paradise. Then I was given three bowls, one
containing milk, and another containing honey, and a third
containing wine. I took the bowl containing milk and drank it. It
was said to me, "You and your followers will be on the right path
(of Islam).</english-text>
