<arabic-text>حدثني إسحاق بن إبراهيم الحنظلي، حدثنا عبد الرزاق،
أخبرنا معمر، عن همام بن منبه، قال هذا ما حدثنا به أبو هريرة، عن
رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال ‏"‏ نحن الآخرون السابقون
‏"‏‏.‏</arabic-text>
<english-text>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, "We
(Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) the foremost (on the
Day of Resurrection)." Allah's Apostle further said, ''While
sleeping, I was given the treasures of the world and two golden
bangles were put in my hands, but I felt much annoyed, and those
two bangles distressed me very much, but I was inspired that I
should blow them off, so I blew them and they flew away. Then I
interpreted that those two bangles were the liars between whom I
was (i.e., the one of San`a' and the one of Yamama).</english-text>
